# Human Firewall

**Human Firewall** is an advanced cybersecurity ecosystem designed to protect organizations from phishing attacks and social engineering threats. It combines real-time email analysis, URL scanning, and employee security training into a unified platform powered by a hybrid detection engine.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI Email Analyzer**: Hybrid analysis combining a Deep Neural Network (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) with heuristic rules to detect phishing markers in email headers and content.
- **URL Phishing Scanner**: Real-time domain reputation check, brand spoofing detection, and typosquatting analysis for suspicious links.
- **Browser Extension (URL Analyser)**: A Manifest V3 Chrome extension that provides real-time protection by intercepting malicious URLs with a warning prompt before they load.
- **Gmail Inbox Scanner**: Seamlessly integrates with Google Workspace to continuously monitor incoming communication for potential threats.
- **UPI Fraud Detection**: Real-time analysis of UPI IDs and payment URLs to detect suspicious handles, keywords, and spoofing attempts.
- **Multilingual Interface**: Support for multiple languages including English, Hindi, and Kannada to ensure wider accessibility.
- **Admin Security Panel**: Monitor organization-wide security posture, track employee risk levels, and review detected threat logs in real-time.
- **Phishing Training Simulator**: Interactive security awareness training where employees can test their ability to identify and report simulated phishing attempts.
- **Detailed Analytics & Reports**: Exportable security reports (CSV/Excel) providing insights into weekly posture, training progress, and historical threat flows.
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Intuitive "Back" buttons on authentication pages (Login) to improve user flow and accessibility back to the landing page.

## 🧠 Detection Logic (Hybrid Engine)

The system uses a sophisticated two-tier approach for maximum accuracy:
1.  **Machine Learning Layer**: Analyzes linguistic patterns, sentiment, and structural features using a model trained on large-scale phishing datasets.
2.  **Heuristic Rule Layer**: Checks for specific technical indicators such as:
    *   Urgency/Pressure tactics
    *   Authority spoofing
    *   Credential request patterns
    *   Domain age and SSL integrity
    *   Typosquatting (e.g., `microsft.com` vs `microsoft.com`)

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **Python**: v3.9 or higher
- **Firebase Project**: (Configuration already provided in `services/firebaseConfig.ts`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/humanfirewall.git
    cd humanfirewall
    ```

2.  **Frontend Setup**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Backend Setup**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: One-Click Startup (Recommended)
Double-click `run_all.bat` in the root directory. This will automatically launch:
-   **Backend Server**: `http://localhost:8000`
-   **Frontend Server**: `http://localhost:3000`

#### Option 2: Manual Startup
1.  **Start the Backend**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python main.py
    ```
2.  **Start the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    # In the root directory
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🔌 Browser Extension Setup

1.  Open Chrome/Edge and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2.  Enable **Developer mode** (top-right).
3.  Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` folder from the project root.
4.  The **URL Analyser** will now monitor all web traffic and warn you about suspicious domains.

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses **Playwright** for end-to-end testing.

1.  **Install Browsers** (First time only):
    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```

2.  **Run E2E Tests**:
    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```
